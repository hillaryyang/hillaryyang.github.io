Alright, today was unfortunately not quite productive like I'd hoped. I kind of abandoned the textbooks because I've been itching to get into the stuff that's actually relevant to ML, like SVD and optimization and stuff, so I went back to this guide I was originally following, and which is specifically tailored toward ML. I just felt like the textbooks were a little bit too technical, which I guess I'm shouldn't be saying, but I'm not entirely convinced that I need to be reproving that a span of a subspace is contained in the span of a space... or any of the other nitty gritty exercises the textbooks would've made me do.

I revisited span, independence, column space, null space, and bases today, and I think I have a somewhat decent intuitive grasp of what these random vocab words all mean. 3B1B helped a lot. I'm still struggling a bit with how exactly these things work in practice, but I guess we'll see... 

Tomorrow I"m just going to continue with the textbook, and hopefully make it to SVD or at least something more interesting. Today was also spent a lot on making this puzzle hunt activity, so I didn't have a lot of time for this.
