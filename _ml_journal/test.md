Today marks the beginning of my machine learning journey! I'm equal parts excited and nervous about diving into this field.

## What I Learned

### Environment Setup
Started by setting up my development environment:
- Installed Python 3.11 and created a virtual environment
- Set up Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
- Installed essential libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Linear Algebra Fundamentals
Began reviewing linear algebra concepts that are crucial for ML:
- Vectors and vector operations
- Matrices and matrix multiplication
- The importance of these concepts in representing data and transformations

I worked through some practice problems on Khan Academy to refresh my memory. It's amazing how much of high school math becomes relevant again!

## Challenges

The hardest part today was actually just getting started. There's so much to learn, and the field feels vast and intimidating. I had to remind myself that everyone starts somewhere, and consistent daily practice will add up.

## Tomorrow's Plan

- Continue with linear algebra: eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Start learning about vectors in the context of ML (feature vectors)
- Begin reading "Hands-On Machine Learning" Chapter 1

## Resources Used

- Khan Academy: Linear Algebra course
- Python.org: Documentation for setting up virtual environments
- Real Python: Jupyter Notebook tutorial

**Reflection**: Day 1 is complete! The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and today was that step. Looking forward to building on this foundation.
