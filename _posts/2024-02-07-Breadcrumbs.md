I guess that as time goes on, we leave parts of ourselves behind. <br>
Sometimes it's like a limb being hacked off; <br>
splintered, torn, and bloody, <br>
and other times it's a slow melt,<br>
a fire that is impossible to quench...<br>
and rarely, it's an easing, world-shattering relief<br>
which snuffs out the pain of memory.<br>
I'm all chopped into pieces. <br>
I'm left in Amherst, in Wichita, and in Bloomington. <br>
I left behind the child who loved to play in the roadside gutters when it rained, <br>
who loved the smell of sunburnt tomatoes and fresh dill, <br>
and who still knew how to balance her world upon her confident shoulders. <br>

We get used to it. <br>
Every cut and slash hurts less,<br>
and the parts are regrown, in a way...<br>
But it's never the same.<br>
Regrown like cells in a lab,<br>
patched together like a tattered childhood quilt,<br>
a shattered piece of china that was carefully,<br>
too precisely, taped and glued back together.

I suppose that's what defines us.<br>
Pieces, sections, projections of what was once whole.<br>
Presenting our eager eyes, <br>
so bright and alight,<br>
to the world,<br>
whose face has also been too tarnished to notice.

But that's okay. <br>
Because it's the beauty and humor and difference <br>
that comes out of broken<br>
which makes us whole again,<br>
steady in the chokehold of the world.
