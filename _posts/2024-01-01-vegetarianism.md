note: because many people are unaware, being vegetarian means that one's diet excludes meat. (for me, this includes gelatin) the difference between veganism and vegetarianism is the exclusion of egg and dairy products in the former. vegans forgo all animal-derived foods, and usually other animal products, which includes honey and leather.

i’ve been vegetarian since march of 2022, i’m pretty sure, so two years now. contrary to the stereotype, i’m not a huge advocate of being vegetarian (although this post may very well contradict that) and it's not something that comes up often, unless i'm out for a meal. but i do get asked by nearly everyone who learns/who i tell, “why?”

it's a very valid question. according to most sources, reasons for being vegetarian include: health or weight loss, religious convictions, economic barriers to eating meat, or concerns about animal welfare. but in my case, none of these reasons really necessitate me being so. i'm not religious, i don't pay attention to the so-called health benefits of forgoing meat, and i live in circumstances where meat could be accessible to me. the only reason that partially explains my vegetarianism could be protecting animal welfare, but i feel that this is only the basis for the explanation, which i'll elaborate on.

i hate the idea of taking away the life of a highly-conscious being, much less dishonoring it by careless consumption. of course, there is the quintessential example: humans hate acknowledging the evils of slaughter and blood which taint the meat they eat, yet when it's packaged neatly in the supermarket, we don't even cast a second thought. this strikes me as negligent and indicative of fallacy for those who can afford to abstain.

but am i even making a difference? my family and friends still eat meat, and it's still ingrained in my culture and served in restaurants, and factory farming shows no signs of slowing down. the answer is no. on a larger scale, i'm not making even the tiniest dent in bettering our planet, in protecting animals, or in facing climate change. that is why i think that if animal welfare or sustainable citzenship were my only reasons, i would've given up on this journey long ago.

the remaining reason is moral, and self-centric. i've recognized that, even if i don't make a difference in the world, it appeases my beliefs and my morals, tying into my disgust at the dirtiness of taking a life, no matter how clean it's made to seem. the consumption of meat is something i can easily restrain myself from, and it's in better alignment with what i believe to be right. 

i loved meat, i won’t deny that. but i also was acutely, uncomfortably aware of the implications of every bite, not for the planet, but for me. what did eating this pork rib really mean, in the deepest part of my conscience? could i allow myself to gorge on this animal that nature had so perfectly created, then walk away from the dinner table, without feeling guilty? i already lather myself in the hard work of nature. i’ve taken too much from the world already, so the simple act of restraining from meat sits better in my heart and mind. 

those are my reasons. i hope they give you some insight!
