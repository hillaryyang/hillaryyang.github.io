i’ve been vegetarian since march of 2022, i’m pretty sure, so nearly two years now. i’m not - or at least i hope i’m not - a huge advocate of being vegetarian or anything (although this post may very well contradict that) but i do get asked by nearly everyone who learns/who i tell, “why?”

before i became vegetarian, i was definitely the person who was fascinated by people who didn’t consume animal products. i found them exotic, almost. but now that i’ve joined their ranks, the question amuses me a little. i find it analogous to asking why someone worships, or why they work out. the question isn’t offending, but it’s just not a social norm to ask "why" in other contexts. 

i see vegetarianism in the same way: i don’t understand why the answer isn't obvious to people. or, well, i take that back a little. people are vegetarian for so many different reasons, so the question may offer some clarity, but still, the general rationale remains the same for every vegetarian you’ll meet. 

i suppose i should actually answer the question. i choose to be vegetarian because i don’t think it’s right for humans to take more than we already have; to indulge. this isn’t to say that i have perfect morals, far far from it. i also don’t think that my forgoing of meat is going to make even the smallest difference in bettering our planet, in facing climate change. rather, it’s a overwhelmingly self-centric reason. the consumption of meat is something i can easily restrain myself from, and it's in better alignment with what i believe to be right. 

i loved meat, i won’t deny that. but i also was acutely, uncomfortably aware of the implications of every bite, not for the planet, but for me. what did eating this pork rib really mean to me, in the deepest part of my conscience? could i allow myself to gorge on this animal that nature had so perfectly created, then walk away from the dinner table, without feeling guilty? i already lather myself in the hard work of nature. i’ve taken too much from the world already, so the simple act of restraining from meat sits better in my heart and mind. 

those are my reasons. i hope they give you some insight!
