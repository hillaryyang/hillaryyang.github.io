I was recently sent this poem by a friend of mine. It’s an astounding piece:

<b> The Physics of Love </b>

Mass is not proportional to volume. <br>
That girl as small as a violet, <br>
that girl who floats like a petal <br>
pulls me toward her with a force <br>
greater than the Earth’s mass. <br>

In an instant, <br>
like Newton’s apple, <br>
I dropped with a thump <br>
and rolled to her <br>
without stopping. <br>

Thump. <br>
 Thump. <br>
My dizzy heart kept swinging <br>
between Heaven and Earth— <br>
it was my first love. <br>

And here is my take on “The Physics of Love”, inspired by this beautiful poem.

<b> The Physics of Love, cont. </b>

Mass does not determine volume. 

What is the volume of the human body? she asked me once. <br>
How many liters are contained by my skin and bones and flesh? <br>
I ruffled her hair, and responded, <br>
Why, this is a simple problem of density and mass. Here, let me show you… <br>

But no, this calculation cannot be correct. <br>
It cannot be, and I know this because <br>
When my lover reaches to embrace me, <br>
I feel something within me seeping out, <br>
Tentatively at first, then in enormous volumes. <br>
Yet I am still whole. <br>
So I know, this cannot be. <br>

And when the hand rises to strike a blow, <br>
I look into the eyes, <br>
Full of bottomless tanks of hate. Fury. Pain. <br>
So I know, for certain: it cannot be. <br>

The volume of the human body <br>
Would never be bounded by the simple frame of flesh and bone. <br>
