sometimes <br>
the showers <br>
of sound, <br>
the cursed <br>
drops of memory <br>
and even <br>
the rush of the wind <br>
will cooperate.

the roomâ€™s soft vibrations tickle my eardrums <br>
and the illumination of the screen disturbs my eyes - are they red? - <br>
which beg the occasional close. <br>

the tenderness in my pointer and middle <br>
amuses me, <br>
only through pain can they be rebuilt. <br>

i am so artificial. <br>
plastic teeth and plastic eyes, <br>
warped senses and chapped lips and <br>
a scowl that a restless night of sleep does little for. <br>

in the dark, <br>
i read a biography. <br>
authored by a stranger and endorsed by exhaustion.<br>
which amplifies the throbbing in my head.<br>

as sleep - reason - arrives with a dramatic flare,<br>
waves of relief take me out to sea.
