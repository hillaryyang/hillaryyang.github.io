Hey! I'm Hillary, a current (as of Spring 2026) high school senior. Broadly, I'm interested in cybersecurity/data privacy, applied math, speedcubing, number theory, ethics, and how I can make a positive impact on others and myself via these avenues. I also find great joy in learning and experiencing new things, and this website is evidence! (Although I must say, this project has made me very well acquainted with the art of failure...) 

Right now, I'm mainly using this site as a display of my various interests - I thought it would be cool to have a collection of some of the more or less polished things I've worked on. Feel free to take a look around!
