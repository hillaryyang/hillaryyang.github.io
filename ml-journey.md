Over the next 3-4 months, I'm going to try and self-study ML from the ground up: inside-and-out, under-the-rug, forwards-and-backwards, et cetera. Because I know my crash-and-burn habits when it comes to self-sustained projects all too well, I'm going to be keeping a record here to hopefully motivate myself two-fold. First, who doesn't like seeing progress/time-lapse/growth content of themselves? I love record-keeping, especially in the form of writing, so hopefully in 5-10 years I can look back on this and see how it played out. Second, I'll be able to keep myself accountable. Ideally, I wouldn't need this but alas, I do.

Each entry (hopefully daily?) will represent a day of learning, starting from a rehash of linear algebra and multivariable calculus, all the way up to projects, state-of-the-art models, and hopefully some practical applications of my own! I'll also be taking notes in Obsidian along the way, and will maybe upload those as well.
